# Getting started

Go to the [onboarding page on Confluence](https://lunatech.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/INTRANET/pages/3309469697/Onboarding#Learning-exercise) to see the assignment and what we'd like you to develop.

In a terminal, run

    sbt clean compile client/fastOptJS::webpack server/run
	
then in another terminal:

	open index.html
	
If you see a hello world message, congratulations! You can now look inside the code and start working on the assignment. If you have some errors you don't understand or don't manage to solve, don't hesitate to ask us on Slack!
